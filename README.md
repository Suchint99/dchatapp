This project is a decentralized chat application that leverages blockchain technology to ensure secure and private communication between users. By integrating blockchain principles, the application aims to provide a tamper-proof and censorship-resistant messaging platform.

Features
Decentralized Messaging: Utilizes blockchain to store and manage messages, ensuring data integrity and resistance to censorship.

User-Friendly Interface: Interactive web interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for seamless user experience.

Blockchain Integration: Python scripts handle blockchain operations, including transaction management and data retrieval.

Interactive Notebook: Jupyter Notebook (decentralizedapp.ipynb) provides insights and demonstrations of the application's functionalities.

Repository Structure
app.py: Main Python application script that initializes and runs the web server.

blockchain.py: Handles blockchain-related operations such as creating blocks and managing the chain.

decentralizedapp.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the application's features and underlying mechanisms.

hey.html, ht.html: HTML files constituting the frontend of the application.

ht.css: Stylesheet for the HTML pages, ensuring a consistent and responsive design.

ht.js: JavaScript file adding interactivity to the frontend components.
